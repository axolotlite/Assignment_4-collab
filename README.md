# Assignment 4 Github Collab!

This is the Intellij source code for OOP Assignment 4.
This project is made for me and my friends to get some git / github collab experience.
I've made an outline for Assignment 4, with TODOs.
# Using this
Either download or git clone this repo into your Intellij projects folder
# Basic conduct (Won't accept commits unless they follow this conduct)
When making a commit.
* Write your name
* Write a short comment explaining what you've done
* Do not remove the TODO comment, instead delete the "TODO" part of the comment
* Leave work for other people to do. (Don't finish the whole assignment then commit it all at once)

# This assignment is incomplete.
I'd like to thank everyone who will participate in writing my homework for me for the second time.
